## Fundamentals

### Variable
* A variable is a container, when you use it, it's exact the same as its value
* A variable's value can be overwritten
* Must be defined before using

### Type of values in Python
* Number
* String
* Boolean
    * Only 2 values(`True`, `False`)
* List
    * Index starts from 0
    * Type of values can be different, can be nested with lists, dictionaries and sets.
* Dictionary(key-value mapping)
    * Keys are unique
* Set
    * Similar as List, but values are unique, can not contain complex type of values, e.g. List, Dictionary, Set

### Operator
* Operators
    * =
    * ==
    * etc.
* Precedence(Priority)
    * `*/` higher than `+-`
    * '==' higher than `=`
    * There are more, check in the reference
* Associativity
    * Sorry, I didn't mentioned, you guys can check in the reference, next time I can explain again.

### Function
#### Define a Function
* Reuse code
* Make code cleaner(Sometimes, details are not important when we review code)
```python
def function_name():
    ...
    return {value}
```
Make sure indentations are consistent in the same function, same character and length.
It can be <Tab> or <Space>(usually 4 spaces).


With parameters
```python
def function_name(param1, param2, ...):
    ...
    return {value}
```

## Homework
**1. Define a Function and Run It**
* Define a function with whatever name
* Define a list with 5 number items, the values are whatever
* Do an expression(operation): `1st + (2nd + 3rd) * (4th - 5th)`
* Return the result of the expression, you can just return the expression or put the result to a variable and return the variable
* Call the whatever name function, make sure the result is as expected
* Optional: add a parameter in the function called whatever, change the expression to: `1st + (2nd + 3rd) * (4th - 5th) - parameter`, make sure the result is as expected.
* If defining a function is difficult, you can skip it and just run the expression

**2. Read what we've learnt in this session in Python Official Tutorial and try to run it**

**3. If got time, read something about condition statement(if) and loop statement(for, while)**
