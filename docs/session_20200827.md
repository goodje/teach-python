## Review Homework of session 13 Aug 2020
1. concatenate any 2 random strings and print the result
    * 3 ways
        1. `string1 + string2`
            ```python
            print("Perfect", " day")
            # output: Perfect day
            # tips: the operation must be done between strings
            ```
        2. `template-string % (arguments)`
            ```python
            print("%s is %s." % ("Today", "perfect"))
            # output: Today is perfect.

            # %s is a placeholder, it expects a string to be given in the arguments to replace itself.
            # other than the placeholders, everything will remain the same.
            # there are other types of placeholders, e.g. numbers, check more in the official doc via the link below
            # https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formatting
            ```
        3. `template-string.format(arguments)`
            ```python
            print("{} is a {} day.".format("Today", "wonderful"))
            # output: Today is a wonderful day.

            # Similar to 2, there is a template with placeholders {} in it and arguments which will replace the
            # placeholders in the template, but this way is safer because it's not type sensitive, meaning you
            # don't have to specify the type of the arguments in the template and the number of arguments can be
            # more than the placeholder in the template.
            ```

## Homework
```python
scores = [
    {'name': 'Jim', 'maths': 8, 'english': 4},
    {'name': 'Harry', 'maths': 3, 'english': 4},
    {'name': 'Larry', 'maths': 8, 'english': 8}
]

# Overall score
# the scores of either maths or english is equal to or higher than 6 is considered B
# the scores of both maths and english are equal to or higher than 6 are considered A
# otherwise, it is considered C
```
1. With code snippet above, print the scores of 2nd item using
`{name}'s maths score is {maths score}, english score is {english score}` in the 3 ways.
The expected output is `Harry's maths score is 3, english score is 4`
2. Print the scores of 2nd item using the template
`{name}'s maths score is {maths score}, english score is {english score}. His or Her overall score is {overall score}.`
in the 3 ways.
The expected output is `Harry's maths score is 3, english score is 4. His or Her overall score is C.`
3. Print everyone's score using `for` statement using the template mentioned in 1 in the 3 ways.
If you want to challenge yourself, using the template mentioned in 2.
4. (Optional)Find out who is the best at English, and print it in `{name} is the best at English.`
The expected output is `Larry is the best at English.`. Clue: You may need to use `for` statement as well.
4. (Optional)Find out which item in the list of `scores` has the best English score, and print it in
`Item {sequence 0, 1, 2} has the best English score.`
The expected output is `Item 2 has the best English score.`.

Clue for way 1, you may need the function `str()` to convert a number to a string because the scores are all
integers(number), so you may be not able to use `+` to concatenate a string and a number.
```python
# a example of using str()
print(5 == '5') # False
print(str(5) == '5') # True

print("Current hour is " + 5) # error
print("Current hour is " + str(5)) # Current hour is 5
```
